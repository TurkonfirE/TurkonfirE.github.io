    <p>
      I help small businesses understand what's actually driving their performance. 
      Using statistical analysis, I identify which factors matter, which don't, 
      and what to optimize. You get clear answers, not guesswork.

      <p>
        I am a Data Science student at the University of Michigan. I built an 
        analysis pipeline from scratch using custom, efficient linear algebra packages 
        in C++ and Python; utilizing automatic model selection, normalization, and optimization.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've spent years teaching complex concepts clearly-from piano lessons 
        to AP Stats and Computer Science tutoring. I bring that same clarity to data analysis: 
        you'll understand exactly what your numbers mean and what to do about them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Tools I use:</strong> C++, Python, SQL, statistical modeling, 
        regression analysis, data visualization
